## Notes

Just a few notes on exploring this graph.

* my initial focus is on the topology vs the knowledge representation
* Since the @graph defines no @id these are all really in the default graph (if placed in a 
  triple store).   So just split them for now.
* Some initial frames and shapes might be useful for inspection
