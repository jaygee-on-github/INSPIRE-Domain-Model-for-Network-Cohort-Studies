## Notes


1) I notice a lot of source using schema:Dataset when that namespace is not defined
   this seems to be a GeoNode issue?  With @vocab there is can simply (must) be Dataset
2) expanding the ID to carry the property value in one example, this improves interop 
   by passing the schema used

Just a few notes on exploring this graph.

* my initial focus is on the topology vs the knowledge representation
* Since the @graph defines no @id these are all really in the default graph (if placed in a 
  triple store).   So just split them for now.
* Some initial frames and shapes might be useful for inspection
