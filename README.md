# INSPIRE-Domain-Model-for-Network-Cohort-Studies
## Background
## Scope
Using schemas from schema.org with JSON-LD, INSPIRE has constructed a domain model that is being used to conduct a ***network cohort study***. In a network cohort study the data stays at home while the ***study definition*** and one or more ***data analysis workbenches*** that execute the study definition are shared.

In the INSPIRE domain model the study definition has two parts. In the first part independent and dependent variables are enumerated
## Upper Model
