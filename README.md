# INSPIRE-Domain-Model-for-Network-Cohort-Studies
## Background
## Scope
Using schemas from schema.org with JSON-LD, INSPIRE has constructed a domain model that is being used to conduct a ***network cohort study***. In a network cohort study the data stays at home while the ***study definition*** and one or more ***data analysis workbenches*** that execute the study definition are shared.

In the INSPIRE domain model the study definition has two parts. In the first part called the study scope independent and dependent variables are enumerated. Independent variables are exposures and interventions. Dependent variables are health conditions. In the second part called the study design, the independent and dependent variables are mapped to target and outcome cohorts in that order.
